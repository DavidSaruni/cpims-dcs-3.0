# cpims-dcs-3.0
CPIMS DCS upgrade

cpovc_registry

CODE BASE
Refactored all the code base for cpovc_registry to python 2.7 compatible.

URLS
Complete tests for urls.

MODELS
we wrote test for models.
Here you will see that we first imported TestCase and derived our test classes from it, using descriptive names so that we can easily identify any failing tests in the test output. We then call setUpTestData() to create objects that we will use but not modify in any of the test methods.

FORMS
Tests for forms are also written
currently tests for user login forms are done.

HTML
Ensured all htmls unclosed tags are closed

VIEWS
Currently working on views
